# CO2_emission
`This repository will become more complete over time by adding more supervised machine learning methods`

In this repository, some supervised machine learning algorithms are implemented on a dataset of car features to predict their CO2 emissions. This repository contains one .ipynb file which has the Python codes and one .CSV file containing car features.
